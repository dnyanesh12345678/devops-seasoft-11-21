# Idempotence
- Before moving further you should know what is idempotence and how ansible use idempotence.
- Idempotence is the concept which is borrowed from Mathematics.
- Ansible uses this concept very much.
- An idempotence refers one operation can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial apply.
- Hence all modules of Ansible are idempotent.
