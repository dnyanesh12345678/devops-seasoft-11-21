# What are we doing with this playbook?
* Using this playbook we are creating loop based tasks.
* Sometimes you want to repeat a tasks multiple times. In computer programming, this is called a loop.
* Common use case of Ansible loops are
  - Changing ownership on several files and dictionaries with the file module.
  - Creating multiple users with user module.
  - Repeating a step until a certain result reached.
- To achive loop based tasks, ansible offers two modules `loop] and with_<lookup>`
* Note : Module loop can be used from Ansible version 2.5. 
* It’s not a complete replacement of <with_lookup> as it is still recommended to use most use cases
