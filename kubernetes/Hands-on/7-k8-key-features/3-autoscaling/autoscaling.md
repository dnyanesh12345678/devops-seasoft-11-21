# Type of scaling
- There are two types of scaling

* Horizondal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
- Modifying the compute resources of an existing cluster.
- for example, by adding new new pods by increasing the replica count of pods

* Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)
- means to modify the attributed resources (like CPU or RAM) of each POD in the cluster

# Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling
* HORIZONTAL : Adds or removes Pods	
* VERTICAL   : Modifies CPU and/or RAM resources allocated to the Pod
