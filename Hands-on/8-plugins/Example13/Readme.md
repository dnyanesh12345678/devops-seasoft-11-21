# What are we doing with this code?
* Using this code we are creating EC2 instance in AWS cloud platform.
* Additionally, we will be having new file called `output.tf` which hold all attribute output blocks.
* Post apply we should witness all the attributes defined in `output.tf` file should be printed in command line.

# Steps to execute this code?
* `terraform init` 
   - This command will initialize the terraform in that folder.
   - Also initialize provider plugins, in our case it could download plugins which is relevant to AWS.
   - You donâ€™t need to run this command every time, unless if there is any change in config file.

* `terraform validate`
